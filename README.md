# Books_Ratings_Prediction
In this project, I am trying to predict the ratings of the books given the author name, number of pages and the publisher of the book. The data is the Goodreads books data I downloaded from Kaggle. Data has a lot of other columns, but I think the rating is effected most by these columns.
